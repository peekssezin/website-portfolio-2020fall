This preview really only focuses on the physical layout of the website I plan to create. Everything shown is barebones, and will definitely be updated in the future. The main piece of this draft is the navigation sidebar. By clicking on any given link, the webpage will be transported to the assigned file in the repository. For example, if you were on the academics page, you could travel to the job page, the me page, or the home page.

As of now, the home page is not completely finished. Currently, the home page is made up of five placeholder images that do not do anything. For the next draft, I want to have the home page arranged in some sort of triangular fashion.

The points of the triangle would lead to the different pages, while the middle would contain an image. As of posting this final draft, I am currently attempting to fully realize this vision.

Likewise, for the future, I plan to add content to the main bodies of the three branch webpages, whether it be images, a resume, text, or other files. I felt that getting the structure of the website up first would help with realizing the finer structure details and how the content should be arranged.
