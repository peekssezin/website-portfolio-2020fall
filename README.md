# Nick Pekor Website Portfolio

This website was mainly made to be some sort of way for me to more easily show who I am to any potential employers. Presenting an HTML document seems like something that would peek the interest of employers, and also show that I have some experience in excel. Likewise, the website also holds things that may be of importance, such as my academic history and job history.
