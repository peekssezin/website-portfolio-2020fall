          <p class='title'>As of right now, I have only worked a single job. Every summer, from the summer of 2015 until the summer of 2019, I worked at Kennywood as a rides operator. As a ride operator, I was responsible for not only running, cleaning, and maintaining the rides I worked, but also caring for the safety of guests at the park.</p>
          <br/>
          <p class='title'>During the summer of 2019, I was offered the wonderful opportunity to become a supervisor for a certain group of rides. With this position, I was given many extra responsibilities corresponding to overwatching employees in the same ride group as me. This included making sure that every employee in the group was content and accommodated for, scheduling breaks, and making sure that everyone clocked in and clocked out on time.</p>
          <br/>
          <p class='title'>Ever since I have quit working at the park, I have planned to find another job. As of now though, I have not been employed ever since I left Kennywood.</p>

          <p class='title'>My harddrive failed before this semester began, so my resume, along with all of my other files, were lost.</p>
